# HW1: Basic Image Manipulation
* Part 1 of this homework is writing a program to generate the following images from lena.bmp.
   * Up-side-down lena.bmp.
   * Right-side-left lena.bmp.
   * Diagonally mirrored lena.bmp.
* Part 2 of this homework is using any kind of software to do the following things:
   * Rotate lena.bmp 45 degrees clockwise.
   * Shrink lena.bmp in half.
   * Binarize lena.bmp at 128 to get a binary image.

* [Code](https://github.com/vincent0628/CV2019Fall/blob/master/R08921005_HW1_ver1/R08921005_HW1_ver1.py)

# HW2: Basic Image Manipulation
* Part 1 of this homework is to binarize lena.bmp with threshold 128 (0-127, 128-255).
   
* Part 2 of this homework is to draw the histogram of lena.bmp.

* Part 3 of this homework is to find connected components with following rules:
   * Draw bounding box of regions.
   * Draw cross at centroid of regions.
   * Omit regions that have a pixel count less than 500.
